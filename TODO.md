There are so many things to do...

## First of all:
- **Standardization** of value type definition for value search
- **Multithreaded** value search
- **Pattern scanning**
- **String scanning**
- **Scanning of custom structures**
- **Making the debugger useful**
- **Detection** of patched functions, sections
- **Process information**
- **Attach** by window class/window name/process name
- **Disassembler**
- **Byte editor**
- **PDB parsing**
- And many other things that are realized in reverse engineering tools, but improved.
